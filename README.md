## Overview

This repository contains the code and dataset for a Movie Recommendation System. The system utilizes data analysis and machine learning techniques to suggest movies based on user preferences and historical data. The dataset contains information on movies, such as movie IDs and titles, to generate personalized recommendations. The system does not include cast details.

## Dataset Information

The dataset consists of the following columns:
